Detecting COVID-19 in Lungs using CNN
Initially, the model resulted in only 46% accurracy. Therefore, I decided to use the transfer learning to experiment the increase in the accurracy. 
Using transfer learning, the accurracy was 82%. 
The final implementation is the hybrid combination of self made CNN with ResNet.
